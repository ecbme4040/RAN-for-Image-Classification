Objective
------------

Implement of [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.06904.pdf). Discuss the insight and challenges during the learning procedure. 

Dataset
------------
- Raw Data: 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes or 100 classes respectively [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).  
- Trainset: 40,000 image patches sampled from Raw Data.  
- Validation set: 10,000 image patches sampled Raw Data.  
- Test set: 10,000 Raw Data.  

Final Deliverable
------------

- Notebooks: Including the implementations of Attention-56, Attention-92 with varies of learning mechanism applied on both datasets.

- Final Models: [Shared in Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LoYbE5LzaTNxBVDUkCljdwWkyvYuEeXJ?usp=sharing)
